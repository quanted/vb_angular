# Virtual Beach - Webapp

An Angular v11 web application that uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for mapping and [d3](https://d3js.org/) for data visualization

Virtual Beach is a software package designed for developing site-specific
statistical models for the prediction of pathogen indicator levels at
recreational beaches.

Audience

VB is primarily designed for beach managers responsible for making decisions
regarding beach closures due to pathogen contamination. However,
researchers, scientists, engineers, and students interested in studying
relationships between water quality indicators and ambient environmental
conditions will find VB useful.

## VB-Web Angular Integration

This webapp is deployed using [VB_Kube](https://github.com/quanted/vb_kube) via Django as static file content.
